## First draft


For our first draft, we each had different visions of how the dashboard may look. We sketched these on an iPad and compared them side by side.


A group member shares their thoughts on the first concept below: "Initially, I would like to design a basic representation. There were no actual CO2 emissions. At this point, I thought only one software would be analysed at a time so I had a more focused view of the particular telemetric data."

Reflecting on the second concept: "When I designed this version of the sketch, I mainly considered the common users and professional users. Simple data displays can better meet the needs of different clients."

After discussion in the group, and combined with the clientâ€™s feedback.
We concluded that the sketch of the second concept would work better as a basis going forward.


## Final draft

We continued from the previous drafts with a few new ideas.

In response to the client's suggestions, we made a new sketch that included a server-by-server view in the dashboard. You could sort by the worst offending server and/or application

These sketches considered the alternative views that could be presented to a common user or a professional user. In addition, it contains all data details
