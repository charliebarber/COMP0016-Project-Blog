Sam Dev is a developer at Software Corp.
He works in a team developing software in Python. He has been told to analyse the energy consumption of his software by recording telemetry data of the code he works on. He doesn’t know what library to use as a few exist for Python. He knows the Java team has managed to do this but they use a completely different library so he can’t ask them.
